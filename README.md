Blooper is a reference to the sound a fish makes!
Contrary to what YLVIS thinks fish go Bloop not Blub!!!!

Sadly I there was no time to have an artist make a logo for me so I have chosen to use the picture of the first Stripped Bass I ever caught.
Yes the Fish's name was Blooper and yes Blooper later got renamed Dinner.
